a simple chatbot using the Gemini API by going through the official documentation.

Faced a couple of real-world issues along the way:
• Version mismatch (library supported Python 3.11 while I was on 3.14)
• Learned the hard lesson that API keys should never be exposed publicly after my repo got suspended

Fixed both, cleaned up the repo, and now the project works as intended.

Definitely a reminder that building isn’t just about making things work — it’s also about environment setup and security practices.

Thankyou
